## How to install
Soon I'll build the app and release an alpha version here, so you can download the APK and install in your phone.
Once the app is stable I'll also look forward to place it on store apps, like F-Droid and Play Store

### Build with flutter
I'm doing this with flutter because of the compatibility across plataforms, for now I'm targeting android devices but later I'll focus on release IPhone and Desktop versions
